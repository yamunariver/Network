ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) messages can have various codes that provide more specific information about the type of ICMP message being sent. ICMP is commonly used for network troubleshooting and error reporting. Here are some common ICMP message types along with their associated codes:

1. **Echo Request (Ping):**
   - Type: 8
   - Code: 0

2. **Echo Reply (Ping response):**
   - Type: 0
   - Code: 0

3. **Destination Unreachable:**
   - Type: 3
   - Codes: Various (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4)

   The codes indicate the reason for the destination being unreachable. Common codes include:
   - 0: Network Unreachable
   - 1: Host Unreachable
   - 2: Protocol Unreachable
   - 3: Port Unreachable

4. **Time Exceeded:**
   - Type: 11
   - Codes: 0 (Time to Live exceeded in transit) and 1 (Fragment reassembly time exceeded)

5. **Redirect Message:**

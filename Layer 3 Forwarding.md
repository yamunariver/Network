## Forwarding IP packets within a LAN: 

1) When a host sending a packet has identified that the destination host is in the same subnet, it can send the packet directly to the destination host -> there is no need to send the packet to a router for routing

2) The packet will be encapsulated in an ethernet frame, and the destination MAC address will be the destination host's MAC address

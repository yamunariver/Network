# Network


## CIDR

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is an IP address allocation method that improves data routing efficiency on the internet.

## ICMP

`The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a set of communication rules that devices use to communicate data transmission errors in a network.` In a message exchange between the sender and receiver, certain unexpected errors can occur. For example, messages can be too long, or data packets can arrive out of order so the receiver canâ€™t assemble them. In such cases, the receiver uses ICMP to inform the sender with an error message and requests the message be resent.

## Network latency 

Network latency is the delay in network communication. It shows the time that data takes to transfer across the network.

## DDNS

`Dynamic DNS (DDNS) is a service that can automatically update DNS records when an IP address changes`. Domain names convert network IP addresses to human-readable names for recognition and ease of use

## IPSec

`IPSec is a set of communication rules or protocols for setting up secure connections over a network.` Internet Protocol (IP) is the common standard that determines how data travels over the internet. IPSec adds encryption and authentication to make the protocol more secure. For example, it scrambles the data at its source and unscrambles it at its destination. It also authenticates the source of the data. 




## RTT

`Round-trip time (RTT) in networking is the time it takes to get a response after you initiate a network request.` When you interact with an application, like when you click a button, the application sends a request to a remote data server. Then it receives a data response and displays the information to you. RTT is the total time it takes for the request to travel over the network and for the response to travel back. You can typically measure RTT in milliseconds. A lower RTT improves the experience of using an application and makes the application more responsive.


## BGP

`Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a set of rules that determine the best network routes for data transmission on the internet.` The internet consists of thousands of private, public, corporate, and government networks linked together through standardized protocols, devices, and communication technologies. When you browse the internet, data travels across multiple networks before reaching its destination. BGP's responsibility is to look at all the available paths that data could travel and select the best route. For instance, when a user in the United States loads an application with origin servers in Europe, BGP makes that communication quick and efficient.


## Load Balancing

`Load balancing is the method of distributing network traffic equally across a pool of resources that support an application`. Modern applications must process millions of users simultaneously and return the correct text, videos, images, and other data to each user in a fast and reliable manner. To handle such high volumes of traffic, most applications have many resource servers with duplicate data between them. A load balancer is a device that sits between the user and the server group and acts as an invisible facilitator, ensuring that all resource servers are used equally.

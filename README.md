# Network

## OSI

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework that divides network communications functions into seven layers. Sending data over a network is complex because various hardware and software technologies must work cohesively across geographical and political boundaries. The OSI data model provides a universal language for computer networking, so diverse technologies can communicate using standard protocols or rules of communication. Every technology in a specific layer must provide certain capabilities and perform specific functions to be useful in networking. Technologies in the higher layers benefit from abstraction as they can use lower-level technologies without having to worry about underlying implementation details.



## Network

`Computer networking refers to interconnected computing devices that can exchange data and share resources with each other.` These networked devices use a system of rules, called communications protocols, to transmit information over physical or wireless technologies. 




## Routing

`Routing is the process of path selection in any network.` A computer network is made of many machines, called nodes, and paths or links that connect those nodes. Communication between two nodes in an interconnected network can take place through many different paths. Routing is the process of selecting the best path using some predetermined rules.



## CIDR

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is an IP address allocation method that improves data routing efficiency on the internet.

## ICMP

`The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a set of communication rules that devices use to communicate data transmission errors in a network.` In a message exchange between the sender and receiver, certain unexpected errors can occur. For example, messages can be too long, or data packets can arrive out of order so the receiver can’t assemble them. In such cases, the receiver uses ICMP to inform the sender with an error message and requests the message be resent.

## Network latency 

Network latency is the delay in network communication. It shows the time that data takes to transfer across the network.

## DDNS

`Dynamic DNS (DDNS) is a service that can automatically update DNS records when an IP address changes`. Domain names convert network IP addresses to human-readable names for recognition and ease of use

## DNS

`DNS, or the Domain Name System, translates human readable domain names (for example, www.amazon.com) to machine readable IP addresses (for example, 192.0.2.44).`


## IPSec

`IPSec is a set of communication rules or protocols for setting up secure connections over a network.` Internet Protocol (IP) is the common standard that determines how data travels over the internet. IPSec adds encryption and authentication to make the protocol more secure. For example, it scrambles the data at its source and unscrambles it at its destination. It also authenticates the source of the data. 

## VPN

`A VPN or Virtual Private Network creates a private network connection between devices through the internet.` VPNs are used to safely and anonymously transmit data over public networks. They work by masking user IP addresses and encrypting data so it's unreadable by anyone not authorized to receive it.





## RTT

`Round-trip time (RTT) in networking is the time it takes to get a response after you initiate a network request.` When you interact with an application, like when you click a button, the application sends a request to a remote data server. Then it receives a data response and displays the information to you. RTT is the total time it takes for the request to travel over the network and for the response to travel back. You can typically measure RTT in milliseconds. A lower RTT improves the experience of using an application and makes the application more responsive.


## BGP

`Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a set of rules that determine the best network routes for data transmission on the internet.` The internet consists of thousands of private, public, corporate, and government networks linked together through standardized protocols, devices, and communication technologies. When you browse the internet, data travels across multiple networks before reaching its destination. BGP's responsibility is to look at all the available paths that data could travel and select the best route. For instance, when a user in the United States loads an application with origin servers in Europe, BGP makes that communication quick and efficient.

## RESTfull API

`A RESTful API is an interface that two computer systems use to exchange information securely over the internet.` Most business applications have to communicate with other internal and third-party applications to perform various tasks. For example, to generate monthly payslips, your internal accounts system has to share data with your customer's banking system to automate invoicing and communicate with an internal timesheet application.



## Load Balancing

`Load balancing is the method of distributing network traffic equally across a pool of resources that support an application`. Modern applications must process millions of users simultaneously and return the correct text, videos, images, and other data to each user in a fast and reliable manner. To handle such high volumes of traffic, most applications have many resource servers with duplicate data between them. A load balancer is a device that sits between the user and the server group and acts as an invisible facilitator, ensuring that all resource servers are used equally.


## CDN

`A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of interconnected servers that speeds up webpage loading for data-heavy applications.` CDN can stand for content delivery network or content distribution network. When a user visits a website, data from that website's server has to travel across the internet to reach the user's computer. If the user is located far from that server, it will take a long time to load a large file, such as a video or website image. Instead, the website content is stored on CDN servers geographically closer to the users and reaches their computers much faster.


## WAN

`A wide-area network (WAN) is the technology that connects your offices, data centers, cloud applications, and cloud storage together.` It is called a wide-area network because it spans beyond a single building or large campus to include multiple locations spread across a specific geographic area, or even the world. For example, businesses with many international branch offices use a WAN to connect office networks together. The world’s largest WAN is the internet because it is a collection of many international networks that connect to each other. This article focuses on enterprise WANs and their uses and benefits.



## Caching

`In computing, a cache is a high-speed data Storage layer which stores a subset of data,` typically transient in nature, so that future requests for that data are served up faster than is possible by accessing the data’s primary Storage location. Caching allows you to efficiently reuse previously retrieved or Computed data.

# Network


## CIDR

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is an IP address allocation method that improves data routing efficiency on the internet.

## ICMP

The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a set of communication rules that devices use to communicate data transmission errors in a network. In a message exchange between the sender and receiver, certain unexpected errors can occur. For example, messages can be too long, or data packets can arrive out of order so the receiver canâ€™t assemble them. In such cases, the receiver uses ICMP to inform the sender with an error message and requests the message be resent.


## DDNS

Dynamic DNS (DDNS) is a service that can automatically update DNS records when an IP address changes. Domain names convert network IP addresses to human-readable names for recognition and ease of use


## RTT

Round-trip time (RTT) in networking is the time it takes to get a response after you initiate a network request. When you interact with an application, like when you click a button, the application sends a request to a remote data server. Then it receives a data response and displays the information to you. RTT is the total time it takes for the request to travel over the network and for the response to travel back. You can typically measure RTT in milliseconds. A lower RTT improves the experience of using an application and makes the application more responsive.

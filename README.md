# Network

## OSI

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual framework that divides network communications functions into seven layers. Sending data over a network is complex because various hardware and software technologies must work cohesively across geographical and political boundaries. The OSI data model provides a universal language for computer networking, so diverse technologies can communicate using standard protocols or rules of communication. Every technology in a specific layer must provide certain capabilities and perform specific functions to be useful in networking. Technologies in the higher layers benefit from abstraction as they can use lower-level technologies without having to worry about underlying implementation details.



## Network

`Computer networking refers to interconnected computing devices that can exchange data and share resources with each other.` These networked devices use a system of rules, called communications protocols, to transmit information over physical or wireless technologies. 




## Routing

`Routing is the process of path selection in any network.` A computer network is made of many machines, called nodes, and paths or links that connect those nodes. Communication between two nodes in an interconnected network can take place through many different paths. Routing is the process of selecting the best path using some predetermined rules.



## CIDR

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is an IP address allocation method that improves data routing efficiency on the internet.

## ICMP

`The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a set of communication rules that devices use to communicate data transmission errors in a network.` In a message exchange between the sender and receiver, certain unexpected errors can occur. For example, messages can be too long, or data packets can arrive out of order so the receiver can’t assemble them. In such cases, the receiver uses ICMP to inform the sender with an error message and requests the message be resent.

## Network latency 

Network latency is the delay in network communication. It shows the time that data takes to transfer across the network.

## DDNS

`Dynamic DNS (DDNS) is a service that can automatically update DNS records when an IP address changes`. Domain names convert network IP addresses to human-readable names for recognition and ease of use

## DNS

`DNS, or the Domain Name System, translates human readable domain names (for example, www.amazon.com) to machine readable IP addresses (for example, 192.0.2.44).`


## IPSec

`IPSec is a set of communication rules or protocols for setting up secure connections over a network.` Internet Protocol (IP) is the common standard that determines how data travels over the internet. IPSec adds encryption and authentication to make the protocol more secure. For example, it scrambles the data at its source and unscrambles it at its destination. It also authenticates the source of the data. 

## VPN

`A VPN or Virtual Private Network creates a private network connection between devices through the internet.` VPNs are used to safely and anonymously transmit data over public networks. They work by masking user IP addresses and encrypting data so it's unreadable by anyone not authorized to receive it.





## RTT

`Round-trip time (RTT) in networking is the time it takes to get a response after you initiate a network request.` When you interact with an application, like when you click a button, the application sends a request to a remote data server. Then it receives a data response and displays the information to you. RTT is the total time it takes for the request to travel over the network and for the response to travel back. You can typically measure RTT in milliseconds. A lower RTT improves the experience of using an application and makes the application more responsive.


## BGP

`Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a set of rules that determine the best network routes for data transmission on the internet.` The internet consists of thousands of private, public, corporate, and government networks linked together through standardized protocols, devices, and communication technologies. When you browse the internet, data travels across multiple networks before reaching its destination. BGP's responsibility is to look at all the available paths that data could travel and select the best route. For instance, when a user in the United States loads an application with origin servers in Europe, BGP makes that communication quick and efficient.

## RESTfull API

`A RESTful API is an interface that two computer systems use to exchange information securely over the internet.` Most business applications have to communicate with other internal and third-party applications to perform various tasks. For example, to generate monthly payslips, your internal accounts system has to share data with your customer's banking system to automate invoicing and communicate with an internal timesheet application.



## Load Balancing

`Load balancing is the method of distributing network traffic equally across a pool of resources that support an application`. Modern applications must process millions of users simultaneously and return the correct text, videos, images, and other data to each user in a fast and reliable manner. To handle such high volumes of traffic, most applications have many resource servers with duplicate data between them. A load balancer is a device that sits between the user and the server group and acts as an invisible facilitator, ensuring that all resource servers are used equally.


## CDN

`A content delivery network (CDN) is a network of interconnected servers that speeds up webpage loading for data-heavy applications.` CDN can stand for content delivery network or content distribution network. When a user visits a website, data from that website's server has to travel across the internet to reach the user's computer. If the user is located far from that server, it will take a long time to load a large file, such as a video or website image. Instead, the website content is stored on CDN servers geographically closer to the users and reaches their computers much faster.


## WAN

`A wide-area network (WAN) is the technology that connects your offices, data centers, cloud applications, and cloud storage together.` It is called a wide-area network because it spans beyond a single building or large campus to include multiple locations spread across a specific geographic area, or even the world. For example, businesses with many international branch offices use a WAN to connect office networks together. The world’s largest WAN is the internet because it is a collection of many international networks that connect to each other. This article focuses on enterprise WANs and their uses and benefits.



## Caching

`In computing, a cache is a high-speed data Storage layer which stores a subset of data,` typically transient in nature, so that future requests for that data are served up faster than is possible by accessing the data’s primary Storage location. Caching allows you to efficiently reuse previously retrieved or Computed data.


## SMTP

`SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. It is a communication protocol used for sending and receiving email messages over the Internet.` Mail servers and other message transfer agents (MTAs) use SMTP to send, receive and relay mail messages.

## SSL/TLS

An SSL/TLS certificate is a digital object that allows systems to verify the identity & subsequently establish an encrypted network connection to another system using the Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) protocol. Certificates are used within a cryptographic system known as a public key infrastructure (PKI). PKI provides a way for one party to establish the identity of another party using certificates if they both trust a third-party - known as a certificate authority. SSL/TLS certificates thus act as digital identity cards to secure network communications, establish the identity of websites over the Internet as well as resources on private networks.




## Single-sign-On

`Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication solution that allows users to log in to multiple applications and websites with one-time user authentication`

## CSP

CSP network automation is the process used by communication service providers (CSPs) to automate network management and provisioning for maximum efficiency. Modern organizations seek agility, consistency, and speed in traditional and cloud-centered application management. Network automation achieves these goals by implementing functions like network mapping, resource provisioning, and network testing in the cloud. Communications service providers employ automation as a cost-effective way to meet growing service demand and deliver innovation.


## 5G

5G is the fifth generation of wireless cellular technology, offering higher upload and download speeds, more consistent connections, and improved capacity than previous networks. 5G is much faster and more reliable than the currently popular 4G networks and has the potential to transform the way we use the internet to access applications, social networks, and information. For example, technologies like self-driving cars, advanced gaming applications, and live streaming media that require very reliable, high-speed data connections are set to benefit greatly from 5G connectivity.

## DevSecOps

`DevSecOps is the practice of integrating security testing at every stage of the software development process.` It includes tools and processes that encourage collaboration between developers, security specialists, and operation teams to build software that is both efficient and secure. DevSecOps brings cultural transformation that makes security a shared responsibility for everyone who is building the software.



## Cryptography

Cryptography is the practice of protecting information through the use of coded algorithms, hashes, and signatures. The information can be at rest (such as a file on a hard drive), in transit (such as electronic communication exchanged between two or more parties), or in use (while computing on data). Cryptography has four primary goals:

Confidentiality – Makes information available to only authorized users.
Integrity – Ensures that information has not been manipulated.
Authentication – Confirms the authenticity of information or the identity of a user.
Non-repudiation – Prevents a user from denying prior commitments or actions.
Cryptography uses a number of low-level cryptographic algorithms to achieve one or more of these information security goals. These tools include encryption algorithms, digital signature algorithms, hash algorithms, and other functions. This page will describe a few of the most commonly used low-level cryptographic algorithms.

## Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is the practice of safeguarding computers, networks, software applications, critical systems, and data from potential digital threats. Organizations have the responsibility of securing data to maintain customer trust and meet regulatory compliance. They use cybersecurity measures and tools to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access, as well as prevent disruptions in business operations due to unwanted network activity. Organizations implement cybersecurity by streamlining digital defense amongst people, processes, and technologies. 

## DDOS

A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is a malicious attempt to affect the availability of a targeted system, such as a website or Application, to legitimate end users. Typically, attackers generate large volumes of packets or requests ultimately overwhelming the target system. In case of a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, and the attacker uses multiple compromised or controlled sources to generate the attack.

## CLI

A command line interface (CLI) is a software mechanism you use to interact with your operating system using your keyboard. 

## NAS

Network-attached Storage (NAS) is a file-dedicated Storage device that makes data continuously available for employees to collaborate effectively over a network. Any Computer network has interconnected server machines and client machines that send requests to the servers. NAS devices are specialized servers that handle only data Storage and file-sharing requests. They provide fast, secure, and reliable Storage services to private networks.

## DataBase

`A database is an electronically stored, systematic collection of data.` It can contain any type of data, including words, numbers, images, videos, and files. You can use software called a database management system (DBMS) to store, retrieve, and edit data. In computer systems, the word database can also refer to any DBMS, to the database system, or to an application associated with the database.

## CIDR

Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) is an IP address allocation method that improves data routing efficiency on the internet.

## ICMP

The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a set of communication rules that devices use to communicate data transmission errors in a network. In a message exchange between the sender and receiver, certain unexpected errors can occur. For example, messages can be too long, or data packets can arrive out of order so the receiver canâ€™t assemble them. In such cases, the receiver uses ICMP to inform the sender with an error message and requests the message be resent.


## DDNS

Dynamic DNS (DDNS) is a service that can automatically update DNS records when an IP address changes. Domain names convert network IP addresses to human-readable names for recognition and ease of use
